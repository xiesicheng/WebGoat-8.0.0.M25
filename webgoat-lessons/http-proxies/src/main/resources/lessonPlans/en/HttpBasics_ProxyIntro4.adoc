=== Exclude WebGoat internal requests

Before we start diving into intercepting requests with ZAP we need to exclude the internal requests from the WebGoat
framework otherwise ZAP will also stop at all the requests which are only necessary for the internal working of WebGoat.

Right click on one of the links in history tab and select: `Exclude from -> Proxy`, see image below:

{nbsp}

A new window will open and add the following entries:

```
http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/service/.*
http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/.*.lesson.lesson
```

Click Ok to close the window, ZAP will now no longer proxy internal WebGoat requests.
