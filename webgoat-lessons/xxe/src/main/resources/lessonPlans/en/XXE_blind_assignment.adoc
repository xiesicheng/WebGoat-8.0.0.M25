== Blind XXE assignment

In the previous page we showed you how you can ping a server with a XXE attack, in this assignment try to make a DTD
which will upload the contents of ~/.webgoat/plugin/XXE/secret.txt to our server. You can use WebWolf to serve your
DTD.


|===
|OS |Location

|Linux
|`/home/USER/.webgoat-webGoatVersion:version[]/XXE/secret.txt`

|Windows
|`c:/Users/USER/.webgoat-webGoatVersion:version[]/XXE/secret.txt`

|Docker
|`/home/webgoat/.webgoat-webGoatVersion:version[]/XXE/secret.txt`
|===

Try to upload this file using WebWolf landing page for example: `webWolfRootLink:landing?text=contents_file[noLink]`
(NOTE: this endpoint is under your full control)
Once you obtained the contents of the file post it as a new comment on the page and you will solve the lesson.
